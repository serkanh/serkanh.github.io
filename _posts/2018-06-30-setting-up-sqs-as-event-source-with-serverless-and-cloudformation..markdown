##### AWS recently announced SQS as an event source for lambda functions. This is now GA and looks like there is already a [pr](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/pull/5074) for it to to be soon implemened in [serverless framework](https://serverless.com/) as well. 

##### As soon as it was announced we had a use case for this implementation in a project that we built with serverless . So instead of waiting pr to be merged  i decided to impletemented via cloudformation. 

##### Below is the `serverless.yml` file with its entirety. Cloudformation creates a sqs and and EventSourceMapping for the function `supervisor`.

Maximum batch size currently supported is between 1-10 so if you define a  batch size higher than 10 you will receive the error message:
``` An error occurred: mapping - Maximum batch size must be between 1 and 10 inclusive (Service: AWSLambda; Status Code: 400; Error Code: InvalidParameterValueException; Request ID: a03c1359-7cd5-11e8-8e95-8fcb11ee2f63).```
